<h1>Stair light</h1>
Photos and stl files are available my thingiverse site:<br/>

<br/>
I mount it in 50 cm diameter circle hole.<br/>
<br/>
This is OpenSCAD project:<br/>
https://openscad.org/<br/>
Use this tool to generate STL files.<br/>
<br/>
I used BOSL library for designing. <br/>
Here is documentation and istruction how to install this library:<br/>
https://github.com/revarbat/BOSL/wiki<br/>
<br/>
All variables are placed in "StairLight_Vars_\*.scad" files.<br/>
You can use those files to customize model.<br/>
All variables have short description, however you can check meaning of variable<br/>
by changing it and observing what is changed in 3D model.<br/>
